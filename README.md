## ðŸ¤– AI Features Setup

To enable full AI functionality, you'll need to set up an OpenAI API key:

### 1. Get an OpenAI API Key
- Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- Sign up or log in to your account
- Create a new API key

### 2. Configure the API Key
Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
# Create .env file
touch .env
```

Add your API key to the `.env` file:
```env
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 3. Restart the Development Server
After adding the API key, restart your development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Verify Setup
- Open your browser's developer console (F12)
- Look for "ðŸ”‘ API Key Status: âœ… Valid" in the console
- The chat interface will show "Demo Mode" if no valid API key is detected

**Note**: Without an API key, the app will run in demo mode with simulated responses.

## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

## OpenAI Integration

This project includes AI chat functionality powered by OpenAI. To use this feature:

1. Get an API key from [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory (it's already included in .gitignore)
3. Add your API key to the `.env` file:
   ```
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```
4. Restart your development server if it's already running

Without a valid API key, the application will fall back to simulated AI responses.
